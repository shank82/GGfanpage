            <p> If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Look at them little rascals.

Let's do that again. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.

Have fun with it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.

              We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Learn when to stop. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.
