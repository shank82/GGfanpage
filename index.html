                <p> Yes, you heard correctly. They are coming back to do it again. Not only did Thanos put a major damper on our love for the Avengers, but we just hadn't heard anything about GOTG3. But, back to jam out, save the galaxy, ours truly we have lift off for a third movie. How could they really ever top what has already been done.
                  I seriously shed a few tears when Groot made the handle for Stormbreaker.... Chillls, I know Avengers reference but what else have I had, dramatics!! Any way, stay tuned for more info as I get it you will have it!
