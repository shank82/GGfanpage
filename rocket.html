<h1> Rocket </h1>

 <p>
   89P13 is a genetically enhanced raccoon turned freelance criminal, calling himself Rocket. Alongside his friend and partner Groot, Rocket traveled the galaxy picking up bounties until they met Star-Lord who then convinced them to assist him to sell the Orb for a massive profit. However as it was discovered that the Orb was one of the Infinity Stones which was being sought out by Ronan the Accuser, Rocket was convinced to risk everything to stop Ronan's plans to destroy Xandar and enslave the world. During the ensuing conflict, Rocket managed to assist his friends in destroying Ronan, despite Groot being killed. He then became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy alongside the newly planted baby Groot.

  Rocket continued working with the Guardians when they were hired by the Sovereign to slay the Abilisk, however Rocket took the job as a way to steal Anulax Batteries to sell. This angered Ayesha who declared war on the Guardians, hiring the Ravagers to capture them. Rocket and Groot were soon captured by Taserface, who had taken command from Yondu Udonta, which forced Rocket and Udonta to work together to break free and kill Taserface. During his time with Udonta, Rocket learned how to be a better person and understood how much he loves his Guardians family, and joined the Battle on Ego's Planet.

Four years later, the Guardians picked up Thor after he and his people were attacked and slaughtered by Thanos, who had resumed his quest for the Infinity Stones himself. The Guardians split up; while the rest of the team returned to Knowhere to find the Aether, Rocket and Groot accompanied Thor to Nidavellir to obtain the weapon Stormbreaker. Using the Bifrost Bridge, the trio traveled to Earth to join the Battle of Wakanda. Their efforts to stop Thanos proved for naught in the end, and Rocket was one of the only Guardians to survive Thanos' subsequent mass slaughter, along with Nebula.
